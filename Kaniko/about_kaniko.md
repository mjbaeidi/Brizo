# Kaniko in GitLab CI/CD

## Introduction

Kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster. It doesn't require a privileged Docker daemon to build, making it a secure and efficient choice for CI/CD pipelines.It can be replaced with dind service.

## Security Benefits

1. **No Privileged Daemon**: Kaniko runs without requiring a privileged Docker daemon, reducing the attack surface and improving security.
2. **Isolated Builds**: Each build runs in a separate container, ensuring that builds are isolated from each other.
3. **Registry Authentication**: Kaniko supports secure authentication with container registries, ensuring that your credentials are not exposed.

## Performance Benefits

1. **Layer Caching**: Kaniko supports caching of image layers, which can significantly speed up subsequent builds by reusing unchanged layers.
2. **Parallel Builds**: Kaniko can run multiple builds in parallel, making it suitable for large-scale CI/CD environments.
3. **Optimized for Kubernetes**: Kaniko is designed to run efficiently in Kubernetes environments, leveraging Kubernetes' scheduling and resource management capabilities.

## Using the Provided GitLab Pipeline

The provided `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in this directory is configured to use Kaniko for building Docker images. Here is a brief overview of the pipeline stages:

1. **Build**: Uses Kaniko to build the Docker image and push it to the registry.
2. **Test**: Pulls the built image, runs it in a container, and performs health checks.
3. **Deploy to Stage**: Updates the image tag in the staging environment's Helm chart and pushes the changes to the repository.
4. **Deploy to Prod**: Updates the image tag in the production environment's Helm chart and pushes the changes to the repository (manual trigger).

To use this pipeline, ensure that the necessary environment variables (e.g., `JFROG_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`) are set in your GitLab project settings.
